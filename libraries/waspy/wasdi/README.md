# WASDI python programming library (aka waspy)

[WASDI](https://www.wasdi.net/) is a cloud platform for processing 
_Earth Observation_ data. 
It allows expert users to search and retrieve data from multiple 
catalogues, process them, and publish the result over the Internet. 

This is the WASDI  python programming library, a Cloud Development Kit 
for controlling the WASDI environment from python code. Code 
developed with this library can also be easily deployed on the cloud,
with just a drag and drop.

See the [online documentation](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
in particular the [python tutorial](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonTutorial.html)
and the [python reference](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/waspy.html).
