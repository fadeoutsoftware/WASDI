## MeteOcean

The dataset contains statistics for significant wave height (Hs), mean wave period (Tm), peak wave period (Tp) and mean wave direction (θm) for Hindcast (1979-2005) and a multi-model ensemble of 17 EURO-CORDEX GCM-RCMs projections for the following periods: Baseline (1979-2005), Mid-century (2034-2060) for RCP 8.5, and End-of-century (2074-2100) for RCP 8.5.

The following statistics are included providing seasonal and monthly means:

Significant wave height:
For hindcast, raw GCM-RCMs and bias-adjusted GCM-RCMs

Average significant wave height
10, 50, 90, 95 and 99th
Maximum significant wave height
Average Hs when Hs>90 and 95th percentiles of the hindcast
Number of sea states when Hs>90 and 95th percentiles of the hindcast
Percentage of sea states when Hs>90 and 95th percentiles of the hindcast
Average Hs when Hs>1.25, 2.5 and 4 m
Number of sea states when Hs>1.25, 2.5 and 4 m
Percentage of sea states when Hs>1.25, 2.5 and 4 m
