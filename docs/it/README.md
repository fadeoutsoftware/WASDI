#WASDI Doc
##Intro
The content of this directory is the Documentation of the WASDI platflorm.

All the rst files represents the sources for the Sphinx documentation tool.

The output directory is /docs/build
##Requirements/Installation
To generate the documentation the following requirements must be satisfied on the dev machine:
* python 
* pip
 
The following dependencies can be installed by using pip:
* sphinx -> ```pip install sphinx```
* javasphinx -> ```pip install javasphinx```
* read the docs theme -> ```pip install sphinx_rtd_theme```
 
 an HotFix was required to use the javasphinx library.
 In versioning there is a modified version of the ```domain.py``` file
 Looking at the last lines of the conf.py we can see one line to substitute this file on readthedocs server.
 DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE ! 
 To fix the problem on your local machine check whether the javasphinx library is installed and substitute just 
 domain.py file.
 
 (usually pip install on ```[..]/site-package/[]``` directory)
 
##Generate the documentation
To generate the documentation, open a terminal and launch the following command:
```
make html
```

##Webhooks and ReadTheDocs
The project has a direct connection, through a webhook, from the master branch of WASDI 
and the ReadTheDocs service.
After an event on master, like a commit or a merge, the documentation compile is triggered 
and the resulting webpages are published on https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/
