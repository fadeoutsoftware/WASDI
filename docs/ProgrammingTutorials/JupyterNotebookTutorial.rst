Jupyter Notebook Tutorial
===========================

This tutorial will guide you through the creation and usage of `Python Jupyter Notebooks in WASDI <https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UserManual/UsingYourWorkspace.html#open-jupyter>`_.

It follows the webinar we did for the ESA NoR:

.. youtube:: eNkWPD7nehY

Prerequisites
---------------------------

You will need:

- a valid WASDI user
- a workspace

You don't have them? Then `go get them <../GettingStarted/WasdiTutorial.rst>`_!

Create and Open Jupyter Lab
---------------------------

Open the workspace and once you are in the editor, click on the "Create Jupyter" button:

An alert will invite you to wait for it to be ready. Do it: click OK, but wait a moment

Jupyter won't open automatically. If you pay attention, you will notice that the button changed into "Open Jupyter"

Click on it, and Jupyter Lab will open in another tab of the browser
