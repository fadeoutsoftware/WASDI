Octave Tutorial
===========================

This tutorial showcase the capabilities of WASDI Octave library.
For more information about Octave and Matlab compatibility, please check the following  `URL <https://octave.org/#:~:text=The%20Octave%20syntax%20is%20largely,operations%20on%20vectors%20and%20matrices.>`
WASDI, by leveraging libraries, allows developers to upload and run applications directly in the cloud, using 
powerful cloud resources and data providers enabling intensive model execution.

The tutorial is divided upon two main parts : 
- Local setup 
- Octave package management
- WASDI deployment and execution 

During the first part of this tutorial the execution of the code will be done on a local environment. 
For the sake of simplicity few operations will be included keeping the actual operational code as small as possible.
Next a brief introduction to the Octave package management in WASDI is presented.
The last phase will be to adapt the code to be deployed in a new WASDI application, to be executed in the cloud.
