Accessing Documentation
---------------------------

To access WASDI documentation directly from `www.WASDI.net <http://wasdi.net>` , select the documentation button in the navigation bar. Alternatively, you may also select the user profile dropdown (represented by the Alien head) and select “Docs” from the dropdown.

Both options will re-direct you to the WASDI documentation.

Sending Feedback
---------------------------

To send feedback or report bugs to the WASDI team, select the speech bubble icon in the navigation bar. This will open a dialog box where you will provide a title and message for the team.

Both input fields must be filled out in order to send the message. The message will be sent via email and the email address associated with you WASDI account will be included with the feedback.
