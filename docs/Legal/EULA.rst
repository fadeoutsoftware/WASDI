EULA
===================================================================


1. Introduction 
---------------------------
1.1. WASDI is a cloud service provided by WASDI Sarl (“WASDI”, “we”, or “us”). By using the WASDI platform services (“Services”), you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service and any future modifications (collectively, the “Terms”). 

1.2. **Please read these Terms carefully:** This end user agreement represents a legal between (a) you (either an individual or single entity) and (b) use (WASDI) that governs the use of our Services.  **If you use the Services, you agreed to these Terms.**

2. Signing Up 
---------------------------
2.1. You must register for a WASDI account to use the Services. You are responsible for all use of the Services under your account, whether or not authorized. At our discretion, we may make limited exceptions to this policy for unauthorized use of your account if you notify us of the problem in a timely manner. 

2.2. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your company or another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. 

3. Our Services
---------------------------
3.1. WASDI Services are available to you in accordance with these Terms. We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable license and right to:
a. Use the Services within 3rd party applications; and
b. Use the Services to develop your own WASDI applications; 
c. Use the Services with a Machine-to-Machine connection with third party systems; 

3.2. Within the trial period and within non-commercial plans you may only use services for non-commercial purposes and for research. With paid subscription plans, you may use services for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

4. Using WASDI Subscriptions
-----------------------------------
4.1. Starting from 18 MAY 2023 WASDI has implemented a subscription-based agreement for using WASDI services. From 18 MAY 2023 onwards, when a user creates a new WASDI account they will be granted rights to a FREE 3 MONTH (90 DAYS) subscription at the STANDARD LEVEL (for information on subscription levels, see sections 5.2 and 5.3). The subscription begins from the first subscription-only action the user executes and continues for the specified amount of time calculated in milliseconds (for information on subscription-only actions, see section 4.7).

4.2. Users who have purchased a Standard Subscription understand and acknowledge that their Node is shared and priority may be granted to Professional Subscription holders at any time in the course of the user’s WASDI actions.

4.3. The User must have an active project and valid subscription in WASDI to perform any subscription-only actions. When a subscription profile is created, an active project for that subscription is created automatically.

4.4. Subscriptions are shareable between users within an organization, but they are not TRANSFERABLE. If you need to transfer a long term subscription (1 Month or 1 Year) please contact WASDI directly.

4.5. By purchasing and using a WASDI subscription, you are acknowledging that if you are found to be in violation of any of WASDI’s terms of service particularly as outlined in section 9, the privileges associated with your subscription will be revoked and no refund will be issued. See section 12 for further information on Account Termination or Suspension.

4.6. If there is a major interruption during the course of a short term subscription (1 Day or 1 Week) the amount of time the interruption caused will be added to the remaining time of the subscription. For example, if the last two hours of a 1 Day subscription were interrupted, those 2 hours will be added to the time remaining in that specific subscription.

4.7. Subscription-only actions are actions in WASDI that are solely available to holders of VALID subscriptions with an active project.The first execution of any of these actions will trigger your subscription to begin. These actions are as follows:
a. Executing a Processor in a workspace (an existing workspace or a new one); 
b. Opening a Jupyter Notebook in a workspace; 
c. Importing a product to a workspace;
d. Executing a workflow in a workspace
WASDI retains the right to add subscription-only actions to this list at any time.

5. Purchasing WASDI Subscriptions
-----------------------------------
5.1. After the 3 months of free access, WASDI offers two levels of subscription, STANDARD (STND) and PROFESSIONAL (PRO). For information on the differentiation, please visit our pricing page at either `our information page <https://www.wasdi.cloud/pricing>`_ or log into an existing WASDI account and navigate to `the Subscriptions Page <https://www.wasdi.net/#!/subscriptions>`_.

5.2. Short Term and STANDARD (STND) Subscriptions are purchased through our payment partner, STRIPE. When the user completes a payment through Stripe, they are not only agreeing to act in compliance with WASDI’s terms of service, but also that of Stripe.

5.3. PROFESSIONAL (PRO) Subscriptions are only available through contacting WASDI. The clauses pertaining to refunding (4.6, and 4.7) are not applicable to PROFESSIONAL subscriptions. Users wishing to purchase a PROFESSIONAL subscription must contact WASDI directly for pricing and user obligations. 

5.4. VAT is calculated at checkout through STRIPE based on the user’s location. The VAT calculation shown on the WASDI website is based on a Luxembourgish user. If the purchasing user is located elsewhere, you are acknowledging that your VAT rate may differ. When you complete a transaction on our Payment Partner’s website, you are confirming that all information, including your location is true and accurate.

5.5. When checking out through our payment partner, you are agreeing to WASDI’s terms of use for subscriptions which are outlined in SECTION 4. 

5.6. STANDARD Subscriptions can be purchased in increments of 1 Day (24 Hours), 1 Week (7 Days), 1 Month (30 Days), or 1 Year (365 days). These times are calculated in milliseconds beginning at the first execution of a subscription-only action.

5.7. Short term subscription plans (i.e., 1 Day and 1 Week) will be refundable if they are PAID but unused. An unused subscription is one where no subscription-only action has been executed. This refund can be claimed within 14 days of payment. After 14 days, issuing a refund is at the discretion of WASDI.

5.8. Executed and partially complete subscriptions of any kind are not refundable. If you have executed a subscription-only action you have agreed to waive your right to a refund. 


6. Service Hours and Exceptions

6.2. Planned and announced interruptions may reduce the effective operating time of the Service. 

6.3. The following exceptions with respect to the Service Operations apply: 			
a. Planned and agreed interruptions (e.g., for maintenance) are not considered as unavailability of the service, since they are not part of the effective operating time. Maintenance windows or other planned interruptions will be announced with a lead time of at least 3 working days.
b. Outages or interruptions from third party services on which the Service Operations rely are not considered as unavailability of the service, since these outages are out of the control of WASDI Sarl.

a. Detected security threats or vulnerability of the Service or individual Service Components;
b. Evidence of fraudulent intent or misuse of the Service or individual Service Components;

7. Service Guarantees
--------------------------
7.1. The Service will be available with a minimum availability of 95%. However, a single service interruption will have a duration of fewer than 72 hours (weekdays only). Scheduled maintenance downtime is announced with a notification period of 3 business days. For further information as to what constitutes a Service interruption, see section 6.3.

7.2. If the minimum availability (§7.1) is not provided by the Service Provider, the Service Provider will grant a service credit in the form of time lost added to the end of any short-term (1 Day or 1 Week Subscription). 

7.3. To receive a credit, the Service User must contact the Service Provider within 30 days following the end of the unavailability via email at the address provided in §7.6 and include the dates and times of unavailability.

7.4. If the Service Provider confirms that the uptime percentage covered by the Service User request is below the minimum availability (§7.1), the Service Provider will issue the Service User a service credit. The service credit is added to the end of the Service User’s term for the Service, and cannot be exchanged for, or converted to, monetary compensation.

7.5. The WASDI Service Level Agreement (SLA) includes the provision of a chat support in a public Discord Channel from Monday to Friday, from 9:00AM to 7:00PM CET.

7.6. Direct support requests should be sent via e-mail to: info@wasdi.cloud

8. Technical and Performance
-------------------------------------
8.1. WASDI runs on different cloud environments. The performance and availability of each WASDI node is regulated by the SLA of the cloud provider that is hosting the node. WASDI can only guarantee the backup of the history of the operations done in that node. Users are able to find out in which cloud environment the services are running and access that cloud provider’s SLA with a link if made available by the provider. 

8.2. In case of any accident in a cloud environment, WASDI cannot be considered responsible and will guarantee only what stated in (§6.1). Regardless, WASDI will contact the cloud provider to get the best possible conditions to repair the damage. In case of a re-found from the Cloud Provider this will be proportionally distributed to the users impacted by the incident, in terms of processors that had been started in that node and files that were stored in that node.
