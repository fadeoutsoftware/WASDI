## What is WASDI?

WASDI is an **Earth Observation (EO) Platform** designed to let scientists concentrate on science — not on IT infrastructure. It provides a cloud environment where EO processing algorithms can be developed locally and then deployed as scalable cloud services with minimal effort.

- Getting started tutorial: [WASDI Tutorial](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted/WasdiTutorial.html)
- User manual: [Signing Up and Signing In](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UserManual/SigningUpAndSigningIn.html)

The idea is that the application Developer can work using the same language and tool as is used to, integrating in the code the appropriate WASDI library. Once the code is ready to be tested, it can be zipped and uploaded in WASDI that will turn it in a scalable cloud service, with fast access to all the relevant Satellite data archives.

The application owner can alwasy decide if the app is private, if share it with specific user or make it public. The ownwer can also decide if the application is avaiable for free or if the users have to pay for it. 

The WASDI web-application it self is where the users can search and execute the EO applications that has been pubished. It offers also funcionalities to:
 - Search Space and not Space Data Catalogues
 - Import images in a workspace of the platform
 - Search for future image acquisitions
 - Browse a workspace, visualize the products in 2D or 3D maps, view the processing history of the workspace with all the operations executed and logs of the applications ran
 - Export the results downloading, or sharing WxS addresses or push in an external (s)ftp server
 - Upload and run SNAP graphs (often called Worflows in WASDI)
 - Upload and apply your own SLD styles for visualization
 - Share with other users applications, workflows, styles, workspaces
 - Save pre-defined set of parameters to run specific applications
 - Run a Jupyter Notebook directly in your Workspace in the cloud

WASDI supports a huge set of Data, including:
 - Sentinel-1
 - Sentinel-2
 - Sentinel-3
 - Sentinel-5P
 - Sentinel-6
 - Landsat-5
 - Landsat-7
 - Landsat-8
 - Envisat
 - VIIRS
 - ERA5
 - Copernicus Athomsphere Services
 - Copernicus Data Store
 - Copernicus DEM
 - ESA Land Use / Land Cover
 - JRC GHSL
 - Ecostress
 - Copernicus Marine
 - SWOT
 - GFS
 - Globathy

The system supports also custom and private Data Providers.

## WASDI Libraries

WASDI provides client libraries for the most common scientific and development languages:

| Language | Install | Documentation | Tutorial |
|----------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Python | `pip install wasdi` | [waspy](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Libraries/python/waspy.html) | [Python Tutorial](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ProgrammingTutorials/PythonTutorial.html) |
| JavaScript | `npm install wasdi` | [wasdi-js](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Libraries/typescript/wasdi.html) | [JavaScript Tutorial](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ProgrammingTutorials/JavascriptTutorialHtml.html) |
| TypeScript | `npm i wasdi` | [wasdi-ts](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Libraries/typescript/wasdi.html) | [TypeScript Tutorial](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ProgrammingTutorials/JavascriptTutorial.html) |

### The key concept: `getPath()`

The only adaptation needed to make existing code run on WASDI is to **never use hard-coded file paths**. Instead, always resolve paths through the library:

```python
# Python example
import wasdi
file_path = wasdi.getPath("myfile.tif")
```

This single change is all that is required. The code will continue to work on your local machine exactly as before — and once dragged and dropped into WASDI, it automatically becomes a **scalable cloud service**.

> [Introduction to the libraries](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted/LibsConcepts.html)

### Advanced library features

Beyond path resolution, the WASDI libraries offer a rich set of features:

- **Search EO and non-EO images** — query satellite data catalogues
- **Ingest images into the workspace** — download and stage data for processing
- **Run another application** — chain WASDI apps together via `wasdi.executeProcessor()`
- **Run a SNAP workflow** — execute ESA SNAP graph processing tool chains
- **Mosaic / subset images** — spatial operations on raster data

---

## WASDI Applications

Every WASDI application, regardless of the language it is written in:

- **Takes a JSON file as input** — parameters are passed as a structured JSON object
- **Produces output files** in the workspace — typically geospatial files such as GeoTIFF, GeoPackage, or Shapefile
- **Can optionally store a JSON payload** in the database — a structured result object accessible after execution

All apps, in all supported languages, can interoperate with each other using:

```python
wasdi.executeProcessor("another-app-id", oParameters)
```

This makes it straightforward to build complex multi-step pipelines by composing independent applications.

Please refer to the documentation center for the tutorials for different languages and also look our Python Cookbook section, with many ready-to-use code snippets for common operations.

## Software Architecture

### Database

WASDI uses a configurable persistence layer. The default in production is **MongoDB**, but the system can also be configured to run with **H2** (embedded, suited for development/testing) or **SQLite**.

The main entities stored in the database are:

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Users** | Registered WASDI accounts |
| **Workspaces** | Isolated environments where users store data and run processing |
| **Processors** | WASDI applications (user-provided code packaged as a service) |
| **Workflows** | ESA SNAP graph processing workflows; the XML files exported by SNAP can be uploaded directly into WASDI |
| **Styles** | SLD files uploaded by users to control the visual rendering of images on the map |
| **ProductWorkspace** | The list of products (files) present in each workspace |
| **ProcessWorkspace** | A task — any operation executed in a workspace (app execution, workflow run, download, mosaic, etc.) |

#### ProcessWorkspace — the execution model

`ProcessWorkspace` is the central concept of the WASDI execution model. When a user triggers any operation, the **Web Server** creates a `ProcessWorkspace` record in the database with state `CREATED`. The **Scheduler** picks it up as soon as capacity is available and drives it through its lifecycle.

Possible states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `CREATED` | The task has been registered and is waiting to be scheduled |
| `WAITING` | The task is queued, waiting for a dependency or a free slot |
| `READY` | The task has been assigned to a node and is about to start |
| `RUNNING` | The task is actively executing |
| `DONE` | The task completed successfully |
| `ERROR` | The task terminated with an error |
| `STOPPED` | The task was explicitly stopped by the user |

> See the [Synchronous and Asynchronous operations](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ProgrammingTutorials/SynchAsynch.html) documentation for details on how to work with process states from your application code.

| Component | Tech | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| **WASDI Shared** | Java | Shared library included by all other Java components. Declares all entities, the data layer, and the view models. Also provides cross-cutting utility functions (logging, HTTP helpers, Docker utilities, etc.) |
| **Server** | Java | REST API — the main entry point for the web UI and the WASDI libraries. Handles authentication, workspace management, and registers operations as `ProcessWorkspace` records |
| **Scheduler** | Java | Continuously monitors the database and orchestrates operations across nodes. Picks up `CREATED` tasks, assigns them to an available node, and updates process states |
| **Launcher** | Java | Started by the Scheduler for each operation. Executes built-in operations directly (download, mosaic, subset, SNAP workflow execution). For user applications it acts as a wrapper: it sets up the runtime environment and then runs the user-provided code as a separate process |
| **Trigger** | Java | Lightweight component responsible for starting WASDI applications on a schedule (cron-style) |
| **Client** | Angular | Browser-based web UI — lets users manage workspaces, browse products, launch processors, visualise results on a map, and monitor process states |

---

## Processor Engines

The execution of third-party applications is the real core of WASDI. The basic idea is that a user uploads a ZIP file containing their code, and WASDI automatically turns it into a scalable cloud service — typically by building a Docker container from the uploaded code.

The abstraction that models this is the `WasdiProcessorEngine` interface, defined in the Launcher.

### Interface operations

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `deploy` | Install a new processor for the first time (build image, register, etc.) |
| `run` | Execute the processor for a given set of parameters |
| `redeploy` | Update an existing processor (rebuild/re-register) |
| `delete` | Remove the processor and all associated resources |
| `libraryUpdate` | Update only the WASDI client library inside the processor environment |
| `stopApplication` | Stop a currently running processor instance |
| `environmentUpdate` | *(Optional)* Trigger a full environment update (OS packages, runtime, etc.) |
| `refreshPackagesInfo` | *(Optional)* Refresh the `packagesInfo.json` file that describes installed packages — relevant for engines that expose a remote package manager |

### Execution targets

WASDI processors are not tied to a single runtime. The architecture supports multiple execution targets:

- **Docker** — the standard production target; each app runs in an isolated container on the WASDI node
- **Local** — runs directly on the host (or MiniWasdi container) without building a Docker image
- **Kubernetes (k8s)** — supported in other branches; follows the same `WasdiProcessorEngine` interface
- **EOEPCA** — delegates execution to an external [EOEPCA](https://eoepca.org/) platform instance

                        Type: personalized_docker
```

### Deploy flow

When a user uploads a ZIP file, the deploy procedure follows these steps:

1. **Check existence** — verify that no processor with the same name exists yet for this user
2. **Create processor folder** — create `<basePath>/processors/<appName>/` on the node filesystem
3. **Unzip user code** — extract the uploaded ZIP into the processor folder
4. **Copy template files** — copy the contents of `<basePath>/dockertemplate/<processorType>/` into the processor folder (Dockerfile, executor scripts, bundled libraries, etc.)
5. **Build Docker image** — trigger `docker build` in the processor folder, producing a tagged image
6. **Push to registry** — push the resulting image to one or more configured registries (typically the WASDI Nexus instance)
7. **Register** — record the processor metadata and image reference in the database

On subsequent nodes (for `DockerBuildOnceEngine`-based engines), the build step is skipped: the node pulls the pre-built image directly from the registry.

### Processor type templates (`processorTypes/`)

Each processor type has a dedicated template folder under `processorTypes/`. Its contents are copied into the new processor folder at deploy time.

| Template folder | Processor type | Key template files |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| `python312/` | `python312` | `Dockerfile`, `wasdiProcessorExecutor.py` |
| `pipOneShotDocker/` | `pip_oneshot` | `Dockerfile`, `wasdiProcessorExecutor.py` |
| `wasdiPythonPip2/` | `python_pip_2` | `Dockerfile`, `wasdiProcessorExecutor.py`, `wasdiProcessorServer.py` |
| `wasdiUbuntuFocalPython/` | `python_pip_2_ubuntu_20` | `Dockerfile`, `wasdiProcessorExecutor.py` |
| `wasdiPython37Docker/` | `ubuntu_python37_snap` | `Dockerfile`, executor scripts |
| `wasdiCondaDocker/` | `conda` | `Dockerfile`, `wasdiProcessorExecutor.py`, `wasdiProcessorServer.py`, `myProcessor.py` |
| `wasdiJava17Docker/` | `java_17_Ubuntu_22` | `Dockerfile`, `jwasdilib-0.7.4.jar`, `wasdiProcessorServer.py` |
| `wasdiCSharpDocker/` | `csharp` | `Dockerfile`, `WasdiLib.dll`, `WasdiRunner.dll`, `wasdiProcessorServer.py` |
| `wasdiIDLDocker/` | `ubuntu_idl372` | `Dockerfile`, `wasdiProcessorServer.py`, `runProcessor.sh`, `docker-entrypoint.sh` |
| `wasdiOctaveDocker/` | `octave` | `Dockerfile`, `jwasdilib-0.7.4.jar`, `wasdiProcessorServer.py` |
| `wasdiJupyterNotebookDocker/` | `jupyter-notebook` | `Dockerfile`, `traefik_notebook.yml.j2` |
| `eoepcaDocker/` | `eoepca` | `Dockerfile`, `appDeployBody.json.j2`, `wasdi-processor.cwl.j2`, `eoepcaProcessorExecutor.py` |
| `local_python312/` | `local_python312` | `wasdiProcessorExecutor.py` (no Docker build) |

The two recurring scripts are:

- **`wasdiProcessorServer.py`** — a small HTTP server (Flask/Gunicorn) that wraps the user code and exposes a `/run` endpoint; used by container-based types where the container stays alive across calls
- **`wasdiProcessorExecutor.py`** — a one-shot runner that launches the user code directly and exits; used by one-shot types where a fresh container is started per execution

## Launcher Operations

### Startup arguments

The Launcher is a Java process started by the Scheduler. It accepts three arguments:

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-o <OPERATION>` | Uppercase operation code (e.g. `RUNPROCESSOR`, `DOWNLOAD`) — must match a value in `wasdi.shared.LauncherOperations` |
| `-p <guid>` | GUID of the `ProcessWorkspace` record created by the Server. The parameters for the operation are read from the database by this GUID |
| `-c <path>` | Path to the WASDI JSON configuration file (e.g. `/etc/wasdi/config.json`) |

### Startup sequence

1. The **Server** receives a user request, creates a `ProcessWorkspace` record in the database with state `CREATED`, and stores the operation parameters there
2. The **Scheduler** detects the `CREATED` record, picks a node, and spawns the Launcher process passing `-o`, `-p`, and `-c`
3. The Launcher reads its arguments, loads the config, and fetches the `ProcessWorkspace` from the database
4. It sets the `ProcessWorkspace` state to `RUNNING`
5. It instantiates the correct `Operation` subclass using **reflection** — the class name is derived from the operation code (first letter uppercased, rest lowercase) under the package `wasdi.operations`
6. It calls `operation.executeOperation(parameter, processWorkspace)`
7. On success the state transitions to `DONE`; on failure to `ERROR`

### Operations

All operation classes live in `wasdi.operations`, extend `Operation`, and their names match the `LauncherOperations` enum value with only the first letter capitalised.

| Operation code | Class | Description |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| `DOWNLOAD` | `Download` | Downloads an EO product from a data provider. Checks for an existing local copy first, then delegates to the appropriate `DataProvider` implementation. Registers the file in the database and adds it to the workspace |
| `INGEST` | `Ingest` | Ingests a file already present on the node into a WASDI workspace |
| `SHARE` | `Share` | Copies a product from one workspace to another on the same node. Adds the file to the target workspace in the database |
| `PUBLISHBAND` | `Publishband` | Publishes a file (or a specific band) to GeoServer so it can be visualised on the map via WMS/WCS |
| `GRAPH` | `Graph` | Executes an ESA SNAP graph processing workflow (XML) on one or more input products |
| `MOSAIC` | `Mosaic` | Creates a mosaic from multiple input raster files |
| `SUBSET` | `Subset` | Extracts a spatial subset from a raster product |
| `MULTISUBSET` | `Multisubset` | Applies a subset operation to multiple input products in one task |
| `REGRID` | `Regrid` | Reprojects or resamples a raster product to a target grid |
| `DEPLOYPROCESSOR` | `Deployprocessor` | Deploys a user-uploaded application on the local node using the appropriate `WasdiProcessorEngine` |
| `RUNPROCESSOR` | `Runprocessor` | Executes a deployed processor (user application) on the node |
| `RUNIDL` | `Runidl` | Runs an IDL application; extends `Runprocessor` with IDL-specific handling |
| `REDEPLOYPROCESSOR` | `Redeployprocessor` | Re-deploys a processor (update) on the local node |
| `DELETEPROCESSOR` | `Deleteprocessor` | Removes a processor and its associated files/image from the local node |
| `LIBRARYUPDATE` | `Libraryupdate` | Updates only the WASDI client library inside a running processor container |
| `ENVIRONMENTUPDATE` | `Environmentupdate` | Triggers a full environment update inside a processor container (OS packages, runtime dependencies, etc.) |

## High-Level Code Architecture

WASDI follows a **Model → ViewModel → View / Controller** pattern across its Java codebase. The shared library (`wasdishared`) provides the model, data layer, and view models; the web server (`wasdiwebserver`) provides the controllers (REST resources); the Angular client is the view.

### Model — `wasdi.shared.business`

Entities are plain Java classes serialised to and from the database. Key entities:

| Entity class | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `users/` | User accounts and authentication data |
| `Workspace` | An isolated working environment per user |
| `processors/` | Processor (application) metadata |
| `ProcessWorkspace` | A task instance — any operation executed in a workspace |
| `ProductWorkspace` | A product (file) registered in a workspace |
| `SnapWorkflow` | An ESA SNAP graph processing workflow |
| `Style` | An SLD style file for map rendering |
| `Schedule` | A cron-based scheduled app execution |
| `Node` | A WASDI computing node |
| `Organization`, `Project`, `Subscription` | Multi-tenancy and billing entities |

### Data Layer — `wasdi.shared.data`

Each entity has a corresponding `*Repository` class. The repository hierarchy is:

```
*Repository          ← public API (one per entity)
    │
    ├── interfaces/I*RepositoryBackend   ← interface defining backend operations
    │
    ├── mongo/       ← MongoDB implementation
    ├── no2/         ← Nitrite (no2) implementation
    └── sqlite/      ← SQLite implementation
```

The active backend is selected via the `dbProvider` field in `WasdiConfig`. All higher-level code depends only on the public `*Repository` class, never on a specific backend.

### View Models — `wasdi.shared.viewmodels`

View models are the data structures exchanged between the Server and its clients (web UI, libraries). Each view model is designed to match exactly what a particular client screen or library method needs. A single entity may have multiple view models (e.g. a full detail VM and a compact list VM), and a single VM may aggregate data from several entities.

### Configuration — `wasdi.shared.config`

All configuration is read from a single JSON file (path passed as `-c` to the Launcher, or configured in Tomcat for the Server). The JSON is deserialised directly into strongly-typed configuration classes. The resulting object is available globally as `WasdiConfig.Current`.

### Parameters and Payloads — `wasdi.shared.parameters` / `wasdi.shared.payloads`

- **`parameters/`** — one parameter class per Launcher operation. The web server serialises the parameters to the database when creating a `ProcessWorkspace`; the Launcher reads them back before executing the operation
- **`payloads/`** — payload classes for the result of each operation. After execution, the Launcher can write a structured JSON payload back to the `ProcessWorkspace` record, queryable by the client

### Query Executors — `wasdi.shared.queryexecutors`

Each supported EO data catalogue has its own `QueryExecutor` sub-package. The factory (`QueryExecutorFactory`) instantiates the correct executor based on the requested data provider. Currently supported catalogues include:

`Copernicus Dataspace` · `CREODIAS 2` · `CDS (Copernicus Climate)` · `ADS` · `DLR` · `EODC` · `ESA` · `Globathy` · `GPM` · `JRC` · `LP DAAC` · `LSA Data Center` · `ONDA` · `Planet` · `ProbaV` · `SINA` · `SkyWatch` · `Sobloo` · `Terrascope` · `VIIRS` · `web plugin`

### Utils — `wasdi.shared.utils`

| Sub-package / class | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| `runtime/RunTimeUtils` | Abstracts execution of external processes. Depending on configuration can issue host shell calls or Docker API calls — the rest of the codebase calls this without caring about the actual runner |
| `docker/` | Docker Java client wrappers (build, push, run, stop, inspect) |
| `log/` | Logging utilities (wraps Log4j) |
| `gis/` | GIS / raster helper functions |
| `jinja/` | Jinja2-style template rendering (used for Dockerfiles and config templates) |
| `HttpUtils` | HTTP client helpers |
| `MailUtils` | Email notification helpers |
| `JsonUtils` | JSON serialisation/deserialisation helpers |
| `WasdiFileUtils` / `ZipFileUtils` / `TarUtils` | File and archive utilities |

### REST Controllers — `it.fadeout.rest.resources`

The web server exposes a JAX-RS REST API.  

> The API are documented here https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Api/index.html  

Each resource class handles one area of the API:

| Resource class | Base path | Responsibility |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| `AuthResource` | `/auth` | Login, logout, session management |
| `WorkspaceResource` | `/ws` | Workspace CRUD and sharing |
| `ProductResource` | `/product` | Product (file) management within a workspace |
| `ProcessorsResource` | `/processors` | Processor (app) registration, deploy, run, search |
| `ProcessWorkspaceResource` | `/process` | Query and manage `ProcessWorkspace` task records |
| `ProcessingResources` | `/processing` | Trigger built-in processing operations (mosaic, subset, etc.) |
| `CatalogResources` | `/catalog` | EO catalogue search (proxies to `QueryExecutors`) |
| `OpenSearchResource` | `/search` | OpenSearch catalogue interface |
| `OpportunitySearchResource` | `/searchorbit` | Orbit-based opportunity search |
| `WorkflowsResource` | `/workflows` | SNAP workflow upload and execution |
| `StyleResource` | `/styles` | SLD style upload and management |
| `ImagesResource` | `/images` | Published band / image layer management |
| `NodeResource` | `/node` | Computing node management |
| `PackageManagerResource` | `/packageManager` | Remote package manager operations on processors |
| `ProcessorsMediaResource` | `/processormedia` | Processor logo / media management |
| `ProcessorParametersTemplateResource` | `/processorParamTempl` | Saved parameter templates for processors |
| `OrganizationResource` | `/organizations` | Organisation management |
| `ProjectResource` | `/projects` | Project management |
| `SubscriptionResource` | `/subscriptions` | Subscription and billing |
| `CreditsPackageResource` | `/credits` | Credits package management |
| `ConsoleResource` | `/console` | Real-time process log streaming |
| `FileBufferResource` | `/filebuffer` | Chunked file upload/download buffer |
| `PrinterResource` | `/print` | Map printing utilities |
| `AdminDashboardResource` | `/admin` | Admin-only operations (user management, metrics, queue management) |
| `WasdiResource` | `/wasdi` | General WASDI info and health check endpoints |

## Developer Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** (JDK)
- **Maven 3.x**
- A running database — MongoDB locally, a cloud-hosted instance, a Docker container (`docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo`), or SQLite for the simplest setup
- *(Optional)* Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers or VS Code with the Extension Pack for Java

---

### Building

All server-side projects are Maven modules declared in the root `pom.xml`. Each module's `pom.xml` uses the `${revision}` property inherited from the parent. You must set this variable when running Maven — either on the command line or in your IDE run configuration.

**Build the full project from the repo root:**

```bash
mvn clean install -Drevision=1.0
```

**Build a single module (e.g. `wasdiwebserver`):**

```bash
cd wasdiwebserver
mvn clean install -Drevision=1.0
```

The modules must be built in dependency order. The parent pom declares them in the correct order, so a full build from the root always works. If you need to build only a subset, the dependency order is:

```
wasdishared → launcher / wasdiwebserver / scheduler / wasditrigger / ogcprocesses / openeo-java-server
```

---

### Configuration

The server reads a single JSON configuration file at startup. A template is provided at `configuration/wasdiConfig.json.j2`.

Create your own `wasdiConfig.json` by filling in:

```json
{
  "dbEngine": "mongo",
  "mongoMain": {
    "address": "localhost",
    "port": 27017,
    "dbName": "wasdi",
    "user": "",
    "password": ""
  },
  "mongoLocal": {
    "address": "localhost",
    "port": 27017,
    "dbName": "wasdi",
    "user": "",
    "password": ""
  }
}
```

To use SQLite instead of MongoDB, set `"dbEngine": "sqlite"` — no external process is required and the database file is created automatically on first run.

The full list of configuration fields is documented in `wasdishared/src/main/java/wasdi/shared/config/WasdiConfig.java` and in the [Configuration reference](https://wasdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InsideWasdi/Configuration.html).

---

### IDE Setup

#### Eclipse

1. Install **Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers** and the **M2Eclipse** Maven plugin (usually bundled)
2. Clone the repository
3. **File → Import → Maven → Existing Maven Projects** — select the repo root; Eclipse will discover all modules
4. In the build/run configuration set the environment variable or system property `-Drevision=1.0`
5. Make sure Eclipse uses the JRE inside the JDK: **Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JREs** — add the JDK and set it as default

#### VS Code

1. Install the **Extension Pack for Java** (Microsoft)
2. Open the repo root folder
3. VS Code will detect the Maven projects automatically via the Java extension
4. Add `"revision": "1.0"` to your Maven runner settings, or pass `-Drevision=1.0` in the terminal build command
5. Use the **Maven** side panel to run `clean install` on individual modules

---

### Running the Server

**Option 1 — Standalone (recommended for development):**

Run `it.fadeout.MiniWasdiServer` as a plain Java application. The embedded Jetty server starts on port `8080` and exposes the API at:

```
http://localhost:8080/wasdiwebserver/rest/
```

Pass the config file path as a VM argument:

```
-DwasdiConfigFilePath=/path/to/wasdiConfig.json
```

**Option 2 — Tomcat:**

Deploy the `wasdiwebserver` WAR to a local Tomcat instance and configure the config file path in Tomcat's `context.xml` or as a JNDI resource.

---

### Connecting a Client

Once the server is running, connect one of:

- **WASDI Web Client** — clone [wasdi-cloud/wasdiClient2](https://github.com/wasdi-cloud/wasdiClient2) and point it to your local server URL
- **WASDI Python Library** — configure `wasdi.init("/path/to/wasdi_config.json")` pointing to `http://localhost:8080/wasdiwebserver/rest/`
- **Any WASDI library** — set the base URL to the local server in the library configuration

---

### Debugging the Launcher

When you trigger an operation from the client or library, the server stores a `ProcessWorkspace` record in the database and logs its GUID. You can then run or debug the Launcher directly in your IDE:

1. Find the GUID in the server logs (look for `ProcessWorkspace guid:` or similar)
2. Create a run/debug configuration for `wasdi.LauncherMain` with arguments:

```
-o <OPERATION_CODE> -p <process_workspace_guid> -c /path/to/wasdiConfig.json
```

For example, to debug a processor execution:

```
-o RUNPROCESSOR -p fab5028a-341b-4bd3-ba7e-a321d6eb54ca -c /etc/wasdi/wasdiConfig.json
```

3. Set breakpoints in the relevant operation class under `wasdi.operations` or in the processor engine under `wasdi.processors`
4. Start the debug session — the Launcher will pick up the `ProcessWorkspace`, set its state to `RUNNING`, and execute the operation
